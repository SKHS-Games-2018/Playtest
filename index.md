## Original Games

  * [Bup Blaster: Riley Bennett](https://RileyBennett.github.io/BupBlaster/index.html) --- Bup Blaster is a game in which the player must survive as long as possible by flying around in a spaceship and shooting the angry bups chasing after them.

  * [Spin: Bryan Gates](https://revo1utionn.github.io/GameSpin/index.html) --- Spin is a arcade based mobile game, were you play as an asteroid drifting in space trying to get the highest spin speed.

  * [First game: Matthew Adams](https://adam1354.github.io/FirstGame/index.html) --- I took a game that I played called ever wing and decided to make my own version to it.

  * [Iron Eagles: Jack Stencil]() --- This is a small version of what will be a larger game where the player controlls a spaceship and has to defend against increasing waves of enemies.
  
  * [Ghost&Bee: Jackson]() --- This a minature clone of a mario map. You play as a ghost with a bee following him. "Fallout76"

  * [Moon Evade: Anthony Feuchtwanger](https://github.com/Buddy312/Adv-Game-Final/) --- This is a small version of what will be a larger game where the player controls rocket and he has to evade left and right to not get hit by the asteroids coming his way and has to survive for as long as possible. When hit it turns off the camera and deletes the Rocket. I would like to expand this to include a 2d version as well. I would also like to add in a 3 life system, but the spawn rate and what is being spawned can be change.

* [Walk With Me: Doug Urner](Games/WalkWithMe/index.html) --- Walk in someone else's shoes.

    Defender
  </summary>
  
  * [Defender: Doug Urner](https://douglasurner.github.io/prototypes/Defender/index.html) --- I modified this game to use the night sky background, I thought that that would look better with the laser. The next thing I want to fix is the way the game ends.
  
  * [Defender: Matthew Kincaid](https://github.com/Matthew-Kincaid/Matthew-Kincaid.github.io) --- I changed the creation rate for the cannon from 0.4 to 0.25. The next thing i did was change the rotation spped of the player from 25 to 40. Finally I made changed the winner score from 5 to 25. 
  
  * [Defender: Allison Maurice](https://allisonmaurice.github.io/WebGL/index.html) --- I changed the speed of the cannon to 40, created a new background with a moon or asteroid, and increased the winner score to 20.

  * [Defender: Dacoda Cummings](https://Daco10.github.io/WebGL/index.html) --- I'll make the background a space type theme and I will make ending more interesting

  <summary markdown="span">
    Lander
  </summary>
 
 * [Paul Mize: Unorginial slightly editted lander](https://Dr-Bork.GitHub.io/flo/index.html) --- I modified where the rocks sit, later I want to change how many lives there is and how the game truly ends, possibly adding more levels.
    
 * [Lander: Andrew Mattucci](https://andrewmattucci.github.io/Final/index.html) --- I changed a few minor things having to do with rotation and speed of the player. 

 * [Lander: Liam Pratt](https://CaptainLeemo.github.io/buiuld/index.html) --- In "Lander", you have to move a space ship from one point to another. There are obstacles blocking the end point, so it isn't as easy as it sounds.
 
 * [Lander: Alex Young](young0904.github.io lander) --- i changed the speed of the ship so that is it more easier to move around the play area.
 
 * [Lander: Isaiah Montez](https://isaiahmontez.github.io/Lander/index.html)--- work on the controls

* [Lander: Malcolm Cisler](https://DatCancerousBoi.github.io/WebGL/index.html) --- I edited the controls so it controls smoother. I also made the level more challanging and added a different game over result.
